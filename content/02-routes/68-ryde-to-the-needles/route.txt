Title: Second Route--Ryde to the Needles

Company: Isle of Wight

Destination: The Needles

Text: No coach travels the western route, which is much to be lamented, as there is no question that a drive over the Downs on this side of the Island (supposing a good road to be made), would be one of the most splendid imaginable.

## Ryde to Newport
Coach to Newport, 1s. You leave on the right, Binstead and its old church, near the coast. Beyond it are some slight remains of Quarr Abbey at a farm house; and an old stone quarry. Further on, towards Cowes are Whippingham church, and Osborne House, the seat of her Majesty the Queen. It has been entirely rebuilt, and stands on a ridge commanding a view of Spithead, the Solent, the Hampshire Coast, &c. When the Queen is there, the royal standard floats over the great tower. The Medina soon appears in its whole length down to Cowes, especially from some points near [Newport](/stations/newport).
