Title: Channel Islands
----
Text: A fine excursion may be taken from [Southhampton](/stations/southhampton) to the Channel Islands. A distance of 104 miles; and, as the communication  is frequent, and the passage to Guernsey averages about eight hours only, we would introduce a brief sketch of these islands before proceeding to the [Isle of Wight](isle-of-wight). The fares run about 18s and 12s.
