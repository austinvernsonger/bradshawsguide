Title: Isle of Wight
----
Text: This beautiful island is divided into two parts by the river Medina, or Cowes, which rises in the south, and enters the sea at the town of Cowes, opposite the mouth of Southampton Bay. The south-east coast is edged with very steep cliffs of chalk and freestone, hollowed into the caverns in various parts, and vast fragments of rock are scattered along the shore. The south-west side is fenced with lofty ridges of rock, and the western extremity of them called the Needles. Among the products are a pure white crystalline sand; of the latter, great quantities are exported for the use of the glass works in various parts.

The island is accessible by way of Portsmouth, Southampton, or Lymington, from which places there are steamers to Ryde, Cowes, and Yarmouth respectively; the first two are more convenient for Ventnor and the back of the Island; the last for Freshwater and the Needles.

Supposing Ryde to be the starting point, two routes will take in almost everything in the island, which a hasty visitor would care to see. Those who desire to make a real acquaintance with all its attractions may spend many pleasant weeks in it, finding new walks every day.

#### First Route

|                               | Miles    |
| ----------------------------- | -------- |
| Ryde to Brading               | 4        |
| Brading to Sandown            | 2        |
| Sandown to Shanklin           | 3        |
| Shanklin to Succombe          | 2        |
| Succombe to Bonchurch         | 1        |
| Bonchurch to Ventnor          | 2        |
| Ventnor to St. Lawrence       | 2        |
| St. Lawrence to Niton         | 3        |
| Niton to Blackgang            | 2        |
| Blackgang to Gatcombe         | 4        |
| Gatcombe to Ryde              | 8        |
| N.B.--Blackgang to Freshwater | 14&#189; |

#### Second Route

|                               | Miles   |
| ----------------------------- | ------- |
| Ryde to Wooton                | 3       |
| Wooton to Newport             | 4       |
| Newport to Carisbrooke        | 1       |
| Carisbrooke to Calbourne      | 4&#189; |
| Calbourne to Freshwater       | 6       |
| Freshwater to Alum Bay        | 2       |
| Alum Bay to Needles           | 0&#189; |

The best part of the first or eastern route may be done by means of the Ryde and Cowes coaches in one day, for 9s. or 10s.; or fly to hold four may be had for a guinea a day. No coach travels the western route, which is much to be lamented, as there is no question that a drive over the Downs on this side of the Island (supposing a good road to be made), would be one of the most splendid imaginable.

## First Route
### Ryde to Newchurch

## Second Route
### Ryde to the Needles
Coach to Newport, 1s. You leave on the right, Binstead and its old church, near the coast. Beyond it are some slight remains of Quarr Abbey at a farm house; and an old stone quarry. Further on, towards Cowes are Whippingham church, and Osborne House, the seat of her Majesty the Queen. It has been entirely rebuilt, and stands on a ridge commanding a view of Spithead, the Solent, the Hampshire Coast, &c. When the Queen is there, the royal standard floats over the great tower. The Medina soon appears in its whole length down to Cowes, especially from some points near [Newport](/stations/newport).

## Third Route
This route, seldom taken by visitors, but a most attractive one for walkers, is towards Head-on-Hill (where fine white sand is dug for the glassmakers), and along the Downs, through the middle of Wight. The distances from Culver Cliff are:--

| To:                           | Miles.   |
| ----------------------------- | -------- |
| Afton Down                    | 19       |
| Ashcy Mark                    | 4        |
| Brading Down                  | 3        |
| Brixton Down                  | 15       |
| Carisbrook                    | 10&#189; |
| Freshwater Gate               | 20&#188; |
| Gallyberry Down               | 13       |
| Hare & Hounds on Arreton Down | 6&#190;  |
| Motteston Down                | 16&#189; |
| Needles Light                 | 23&#189; |
| Newport                       | 9        |
| Shalcombe Down                | 18       |
| Yarborough Pillar             | 1        |

**Culver Cliff,** 400 feet high. View over White Cliff Bay, Spithead, &c. Yarborough Pillar, on Bembridge Down, overlooks the harbour. It was built up in 1849, in honour of the late earl; and serves as a landmark.

**Brading Down.** A noble view here, from the ring; Portsmouth, Spithead, Chichester Cathedral, Osborne, Sandown Bay, Shanklin Down, and one-third of the Island, all seen on a sunshiny day. Brading church, *Nunwell*, the seat of Sir H. Oglander, Bart., are immediately below.

**Ashey Down.** Fine views from the sea marks, but you must shift about to take them in. Newchurch, &c., visible.

**Arreton Down.** View of the cultivated tract to Undercliff and Shorwell. The road follows Long Lane into Newport, but a short cut may be found to Carisbrook or Gatcombe, shortening the distance to the Western Downs, by a mile or two. After Carisbrook you ascend to Bowcomb and Roughborough Downs, and thence to Galebery or Galleyberry Down by a rough path, which now and then leads through a turnip field as it approaches the heath, and then brings you into a solitary hollow, smooth and green round its sides, and patched with furze bushes. You may walk for miles without meeting a soul except a shepherd, or a farmer on horseback. At Galleyberry there is a splendid view of this half of the Island, with the ridge of Down before you, to the Needles, up and down like the back of a camel. To get refreshment, you must descend the slope, to Shorwell, Brixton, Calboum, &c., at the bottom. Another fine view from *Brixton Down*. Brixton is a pretty place (though not more beautiful than most; others in the Island), with a chine down to the shore.

**Motteston Down,** 700 feet high, near the Druid stone. Sir John Cheke, King Edward's tutor; was born at this village. Shalcombe Down; then

**Afton Down,** 500 feet high. Tumuli on the top.

**Needles Down,** 500 feet. A road up to the light, with Alum Bay on one side, and Scratchell's Bay on the other. The Hampshire and Dorsetshire coast to the right, and Portland Bill (perhaps), may be seen in the distant horizon.
