Much like the BBC television series 'Great British Train Journeys' presented by Michael Portillo, this site is inspired by the work of Victoria cartographer George Bradshaw (29 July 1801 - 6 September 1853).

## Publisher's Note:
Typographical errors appearing in the original text have been corrected, with exception of instances where the common spelling of a Victorian word would appear to differ from the modern-day equivalent. Examples include chimnies, Shakspeare and X.
