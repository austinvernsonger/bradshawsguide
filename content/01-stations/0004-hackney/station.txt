Text: On the right, from the midst of roofs of houses, thickly planted trees in the churchyard and adjacent gardens, rises the picturesque tower of the old church, and the pyramidal tower of the new church. In the old Church General Fairfax was married; De Foe lived here, and Dr. South, the wit, was a native. The square building on the right side is the Hackney Railway station. After a short stoppage the train moves on towards [Dalston](dalston), the junction of a short branch running to [Shoreditch](shoreditch) and [Broad Street](broad-street), a very great convenience for city traffic.

On again leaving Dalston, we pass the station of [Newington Road](newington-road), and proceed through a cutting towards Islington, and passing under the Great North Road, and leaving the Model Prison to our right, we arrive at the [Islington and Highbury](highbury) station, at the point where the road branches to Holloway and Highbury. Through the high level of Islington the railway is in a cutting. We quit this near the Caledonian Road, and cross the same by a bridge.
