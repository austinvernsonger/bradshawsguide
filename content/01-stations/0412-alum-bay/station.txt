Text: The cliffs on one side are white, and on the other are curiously variegated with strata of ochre, fuller's earth, grey and white sand, &c. Here large prawns are found. The cliffs gradually fall to Gary's Sconce, where a strong fort is being constructed. Copperas stones, lignite, or wood coal, alum, pipe day, shells, and fossils are discovered in this quarter of the Island.
