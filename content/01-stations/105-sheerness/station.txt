Text: Sheerness, at the Medway's mouth, is another naval dockyard, in a dull, flat part of the Isle of Sheppey, near the Nore. Fossils are abundant in this island. Sailors say that "at Plymouth it always rains, at Portsmouth it always blows, but. at Sheerness it always rains and blows," which may give an idea of the delightful climate prevailing here.
