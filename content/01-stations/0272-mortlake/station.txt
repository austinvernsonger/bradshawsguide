Text: Dr. Lee, the astrologer, and by some called the Magician of Queen Elizabeth's time, is buried here. The remainder of our course to Richmond lies through fields and gardens, catching a glimpse of Kew Gardens, and the Pagoda on our right, and passing some prettily built almshouses, and a castellated building used as a barracks; also, on our right, we come to the station in Kew road, at [Richmond](richmond).
