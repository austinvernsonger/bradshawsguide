Text: This station is on the edge of a most romantic tract of country that once stretched along the whole extent of the county here called St. Leonard's Forest. It is very elevated, and commands many a woodland prospect. The line skirts a considerable portion of the estate to the left; the point of its recession indicates our near approach to Horsham.
