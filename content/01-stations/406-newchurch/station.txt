Text: Newchurch, with its white spire, stands at the end of a short village, near the stream which runs into Brading harbour. The parish is the largest in the island, with a population of 14,003, stretching across it so as to take in both Ryde and Ventnor. Fine views on both sides of the Down, which is 6 miles from Ryde.
