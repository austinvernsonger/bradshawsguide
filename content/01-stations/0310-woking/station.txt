Text: On both sides of the line Woking Common is seen to extend for miles, only broken by the windings of the Basingstoke Canal, and terminated by a long range of woodland scenery, which stands out in picturesque relief against the horizon.

Three-quarters of a mile beyond Woking a line branches off to the left to Guildford and Godalming, direct to Portsmouth, from which another branch diverges at Guildford and extends to Ash, Farnham, and Alton.
