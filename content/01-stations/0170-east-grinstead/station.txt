Text: This was one of the places disfranchised by the Reform Act of 1832. It contains a population of 4,266, and a good sized church with a monument, the inscription on which purports the church to have been founded by R. Lewkner, Esq., the wife of whom had been connected with the courts of Edward IV. and Henry VII.
