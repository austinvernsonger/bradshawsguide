Text: Isleworth, with its picturesque ivy-mantled church tower, was noted for affording excellent sport to anglers. The salmon caught in this part of the Thames was formerly of a peculiarly fine quality, but the gas works and steam navigation have driven them higher up the stream. This place, however, is still frequented by anglers, who consider there is not finer fishing any where than in the Thames from Kew to Richmond.

*Sion House*, the magnificent edifice of the Duke of Somerset, where Lady Jane Grey resided, now belonging to the Duke of Northumberland, was built here, on the site of a suppressed nunnery. The grounds form a fine lawn, extending from Brentford to Isleworth.
