Text: *Wimbledon Park*, the seat of the Earl Spencer, is seen to the right; thence crossing the old Surrey Railway, we at the same time pass over Garratt Lane, the little village adjoining, which was formerly the scene of a mock election, rendered popular by Foote's grotesque farce of the "Mayor of Garratt."

The adjacent country now begins to assume a very pleasant and diversified appearance, and the patches of woodland scenery that break forth in bold relief against the distant horizon furnish an agreeable foretaste of the picturesque views yet to come. Passing beneath a few arches which connect the roads leading from various adjacent villages, we reach the station at [Wimbledon](/stations/wimbledon).
