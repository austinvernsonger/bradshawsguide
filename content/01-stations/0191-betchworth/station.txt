Text: Within a short distance, situated most beautifully in a romantic park washed by the "Sullen Mole," are the ruins of Betchworlh Castle.

They are most picturesque, and the grey walls, contrasting with the rich green of the ivy creeping over a great part of them, stand out finely against the deep blue sky.

Proceeding on our way, with the lofty down on our right, we pass over the Mole by a viaduct 50 feet high, and then through Box Tunnel to the station at [Box Hill](box-hill).
