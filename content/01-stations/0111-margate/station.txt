Text: At the back of the Bathing Infirmary and close to the sea; there is a second Margate station for the convenience of the local traffic between here and Ramsgate, whence the trains run off the main line on a short branch to the right, and enter a station facing the sea and directly parallel with the South Eastern Station.

Proceeding across fields, through cuttings, and oil embankments, we next come to [Braodstairs](broadstairs).
