Text: In the neighbourhood of Pluckley there are several villages and country seats. *Bethersden* the seat of the Lovelaces, a family now extinct, two and a half miles. Great Chart, once a large market town, and many others.

Leeds Castle, however, in general absorbs the attention of the traveller. Of Norman architecture, situated in a beautiful park, and being still in good preservation, it is one of the most imposing and interesting castles in the county of Kent.
