Text: This town is situated on the banks of the Wye, at a point where that river divides into several streams; it is a considerable trading and manufacturing town. The manufactures are stocking weaving of all kinds, fleecy hosiery, blankets, worsteds, cotton cloths, &c. It consists of a principal street, running east and west, and several smaller ones; the church is much admired, and has a handsome spire.
