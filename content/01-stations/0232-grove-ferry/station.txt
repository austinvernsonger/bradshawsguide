Text: From Sturry the main line proceeds in an east-north-east direction, through a highly cultivated country, and enters the Isle of Thanet, near Grove Ferry, where the railway crosses the Wausum, and, proceeding five miles further, reaches the Minster Junction Station, whence a branch line diverges to the ancient towns of [Sandwich](sandwich), and [Deal](sandwich), and the other, the main line, proceeds to Ramsgate and Margate.
