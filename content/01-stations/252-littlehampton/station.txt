Text: A short distance from a small hamlet on the coast, which has some admirers as a retired watering place.

This is the port for Arundel, being admissible for vessels of considerable burthen. It has recently attracted the attention of the Brighton Railway Company, who have established a system of steam communication between here and the Channel Islands. No doubt this will be a means of increasing its trading importance, whilst as a watering place, its seclusive qualifications will still command a considerable share of patronage. Crossing the river Arun, we then arrive at the station for [Arundel](arundel), about 1&#190; mile north by rail.
