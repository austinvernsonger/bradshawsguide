The line passes through an undulating, and in some places a hilly, country to <span class="smcp">Cook's Bridge</span>, in the vicinity of which is *Coneyburrow Park*. We have here a full view of the lofty range of the south downs, the highest point of which, *Ditching Beacon*, a little to the right, is 858 feet above the sea.
