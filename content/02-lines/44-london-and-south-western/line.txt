Text: ## Clapham to Kingston

Soon after rejoining the Main Line at Clapham Common, [a branch to the left](/lines/west-end-of-london-and-crystal-palace) leads to the Crystal Palace, *via* [Balham](/stations/balham), [Streatham](/stations/streatham), and [Norwood](/stations/norwood).

Emerging from the excavation, we proceed onwards over an embankment, which affords one continued series of delightful views across a country which art has contributed in the highest degree to adorn, at the extremity of which a cursory glimpse of the old square tower of Kingston church is obtained.
