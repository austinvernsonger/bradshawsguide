Text: ## Clapham to Kingston

Soon after rejoining the Main Line at Clapham Common, [a branch to the left](/lines/west-end-of-london-and-crystal-palace) leads to the Crystal Palace, *via* [Balham](/stations/balham), [Streatham](/stations/streatham), and [Norwood](/stations/norwood).

Emerging from the excavation, we proceed onwards over an embankment, which affords one continued series of delightful views across a country which art has contributed in the highest degree to adorn, at the extremity of which a cursory glimpse of the old square tower of Kingston church is obtained.

## Weybridge to Woking

From the hill before [Weybridge](/stations/weybridge) to [Woking](/stations/woking), a distance of six miles, there is a gradual descent After crossing the bridge which spans the Basingstoke Canal, here intersected by the canal from Guildford, and passing several villages, we pass over the Woking embankment, whence a succession of picturesque views will delight the traveller. Ottershaw Park affords a pleasing specimen of English forest scenery. The fine effect of these majestic trees, with nothing behind them but the sunny splendour of a summer morning, or the rich glow of an evening sky, realises all that Claude has embodied in his pictures.
